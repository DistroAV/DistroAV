/* obs-source-tally
* 
* Provides a way for sources to be notified when they are in the preview scene so that the
* on_preview tally can be set on the NDI source.
* The latest version of OBS (31.1.2) does not provide this functionality in sources (never did), so this
* libary implements it. It is only intended for use by the ndi-source and mirrors 
* how OBS implements the activated/deactivated callbacks for sources (which ndi-source also uses
* for on_program). It replaces the shown/hidden callbacks which do not work for this purpose.
* If OBS does implement this functionality in the future, this library can be removed and should only need
* changes to ndi-source.cpp to use the OBS provided functionality.
* 
* In addition to OBS not providing this preview detection functionality, there are some other issues with OBS 
* which require workarounds in this library:
* 1. When a source is in a group, the item_visible doesn't get fired when it is toggled by the user
* 2. Items moved to a new group need to connect to the new group's item_visible signal
* 3. When a group is toggled, the item_visible doesn't get fired for the items in the group
*
