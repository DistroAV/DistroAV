# DistroAV Brand Guidelines

## Brand Identity

- Yellow : #FFE619 / RGB 255,230,25 / CMYK 0,10,90,0 / Name: Canary
- Black : #000000 (pure-black)
- Logo font : [Tomorrow](https://github.com/MonicaRizzolli/Tomorrow)

## Brand Usage

- The plugin or its usage should not claim or strongly implies that the [DistroAV](https://distroav.org) project is provided, managed, created, approved, certified or associated with your project/fork or the [Open Broadcaster Software](https://distroav.org/obs-studio) Project, its team-member or activities.

- The plugin or its usage should not claim or strongly implies that the [DistroAV](https://distroav.org) project is provided, managed or created by [NDI](https://distroav.org/ndi-web) (the company).

- When mentionning the use of "NDI in OBS" please referred to the "DistroAV Plugin" providing this feature, redirect to the [official Github Repo](https://github.com/DistroAV/DistroAV) or [DistroAV.org](https://distroav.org) to avoid confusion with both [OBS](https://distroav.org/obs-studio) (the host program) or [NDI](https://distroav.org/ndi-web) (the company) (the company).
Example : "The DistroAV plugin adds NDI support in OBS Studio[...]", or "The NDI plugin (DistroAV) is available for OBS Studio[...]"

- When re-using the code and directly integrating the [DistroAV](https://distroav.org) plugin in another software, comply with the Licences as set per the project (sharing is caring!).

- For a healthy eco-system, if you use part or all the code in your software, please advise the DistroAV Project Team, this help tremendously to identify possible impacts for new releases and also help to improve developement practices.

- If you are here because you are checking the brand guideline, it might be because you have a commercial activity relying on [DistroAV](https://distroav.org), if so, please consider [contributing financially](https://distroav.org/donate) or with your time to the project.

## The DistroAV logo story & design choices

- Two pentagons within in each-other with network-node-like connections
- The central dot represents OBS as our base for the plugin
- The inner pentagon is a representation of the different features & capabilities of DistroAV
- The outer pentagon represents the NDI and AVoverIP ecosystem that we interact with

- The 2 pentagons are off-centred from the background circle and from each other
- The inner pentagon is centered around the central dot
- This represents an always-evolving ecosystem representing our tight integration with OBS while evolving in the broader NDI/AVoverIP ecosystem

**This effectively represents the role of DistroAV as a central connection between AVoverIP protocols and OBS as a plugin.**
