## DistroAV brand usage Guidelines
### Brand Identity
- Yellow : #FFE619 / RGB 255,230,25 / CMYK 0,10,90,0 / Name: Canary
- Black : #000000 (pure-black)
- Logo font : [Tomorrow](https://github.com/MonicaRizzolli/Tomorrow)

### Brand Usage
- The plugin or its usage should not claim or strongly implies that the DistroAV project is provided, managed, created, approved, certified or associated with your project/fork or the Open Broadcaster Software Project, its team-member or activities.

- The plugin or its usage should not claim or strongly implies that the DistroAV project is provided, managed or created by NDI (the company).

- When mentionning the use of "NDI in OBS" please referred to the "DistroAV Plugin" providing this feature, redirect to the [official Github Repo](https://github.com/DistroAV/DistroAV) or [DistroAV.org](https://distroav.org) to avoid confusion with both OBS (the host program) or NDI (the company).

- When re-using the code and directly integrating the DistroAV plugin in another software, comply with the Licences as set per the project (sharing is caring!).

- For a healthy eco-system, if you use part or all the code in your software, please advise the Project Team, this help tremendously to identify possible impacts for new releases and also help to improve developement practices.

- If you are here because you are checking the brand guideline, it might be because you have a commercial activity relying on DistroAV, if so, please consider contributing financially or with your time to the project.


## Back Story
With the release of DistroAV 6.0.0 the project renamed from "OBS-NDI" to DistroAV, to respect third-party licensing and avoid confusion for users, contributors, partners and sponsors.

The initial rebrand in 2024 used a non-descriptive logo with non-identifiable owner withonly one "below-average quality" usable file.

Fast forward to August 2025, there was a need for a vector-based version of the project logo for better quality and possible activiations requirering printing.
This is the time that the team found a possible conflicting usage of said logo with a seemingly prior usage than DistroAV. No vector files existed either.

This prompted the 2025 "1 year anniversary Re-brand" with a complete re-draw of the logo and additionnal transparency of the branding guidelines in general.


## The re-design of the DistroAV logo
DistroAV Logo (v2025)
- Inspired by the first DistroAV logo
- Simplified shape & reduced complexity for better identity recognition
- Fully build in Vector (for better quality / scaling)
- Settling the color to be closer to a usable one across web, RGB, Print
- Yellow : #FFE619 / RGB 255,230,25 / CMYK 0,10,90,0 / Name: Canary
- Black : #000000 (pure-black)
- Logo font : [Tomorrow](https://github.com/MonicaRizzolli/Tomorrow)


## The DistroAV logo story & design choices

- Two pentagons within in each-other with network-node-like connections
- The central dot represents OBS as our base for the plugin
- The inner pentagon is a representation of the different features & capabilities of DistroAV
- The outer pentagon represents the NDI and AVoverIP ecosystem that we interact with

- Insider tips :
- The 2 pentagons are off-centred from the background circle and from each other.
- The inner pentagon is centered around the central dot.
- This represents an always-evolving ecosystem representing our tight integration with OBS while evolving in the broader NDI/AVoverIP ecosystem.

** This effectively represents the role of DistroAV as a central connection between AVoverIP and OBS as a plugin. **

## DistroAV New Branding Guideline
- Avoid IP/trademark-collisions with other brands / project
- The initial logo was adopted without complete review (and mostly was a re-work or too close to something on the public domain)
- Only low-resolution non-vector quality existed
- Colors not really matching for print or consistency
- Looks a bit complex from afar
- Missing Project Brand Guidelines in case of “re-use” by other projects or communication
- Ensure this project is clearly identified as a Plugin for OBS Project without confusion or implication that it is a vetted plugin by OBS (This. Was the original reason to re-brand in 2024)
- There might be some (unannounced-yet) activities that require this project to have clearer guidelines
